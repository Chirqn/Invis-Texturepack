# Invis-Texturepack
This texturepack is for the game sploop.io, updating it since request interceptor doesnt work for everyone anymore, the invis.txt file is a tampermonkey userscript which just runs trhe invis texturepack, if request interceptor still works for you use the invis.json and import that into your request interceptor and press save.
